# Rubik's Cube Solver

This is a Python project to solve the Rubik's Cube using different search algorithms.

## Description

The Rubik's Cube is a mechanical three-dimensional puzzle, invented by Hungarian sculptor and architecture professor Ern≈ë Rubik in 1974. This project implements various search algorithms to find the optimal solution for the Rubik's Cube.

## Features

- **Implemented search algorithms:**
  - Breadth-first search
  - Depth-first search
  - Iterative deepening depth-first search
  - Greedy search
  - A*
  - IDA*

- **Graphical interface:** The initial and final state of the cube can be visualized through a graphical interface.

- **Search statistics:** The program displays detailed statistics on the performance of each search algorithm, such as the total number of opened nodes, the maximum number of nodes open simultaneously, the total number of closed nodes, and the depth of the found solution.
